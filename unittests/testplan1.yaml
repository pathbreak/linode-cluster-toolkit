# A cluster plan describes Linode resources across multiple regions.
#
name: 'testplan'

# 1st Region. Region can be a v3 API datacenter ID like '9' for Singapore,
# or a v4 API region ID like 'us-south-1a'
# or a place label with partial match like 'Dallas'.
regions:
- region: '9'

  # In each region, specify a list of node plans.
  # 'type' can be 
  #     - v4 type ID like 'g5-nanode-1', or
  #     - v3 plan ID like '1', or
  #     - label like 'Linode 1024', or
  #     - attribute based like 'ram:80GB' or 'disk:1536GB' or 'price:960'. The selected attribute 
  #         should be such that it uniquely identifies a type, otherwise the plan is flagged as
  #         ambiguous and aborted.
  nodes:
    # It's useful to give a name to a node plan so that all nodes of this
    # set in the created cluster can be grouped using that name and manipulated
    # together, for example, to startup or shutdown or delete.
  - name: nodeplan1
    type: 'Linode 1024'
    count: 1
    
    # The storage plan below specifies a customized storage allocation 
    # for all nodes of this node plan.

      # have a separate 100GB block store.

    count: 1
    # If storage plan is unspecified or set to 'default', it's left 
    # to Linode's API default implementation. Generally, Linode API creates
    # two disks - a root device with (total storage - 512MB), and a 512MB swap disk.

    # specified, single node is assumed.
